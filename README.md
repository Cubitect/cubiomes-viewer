# Cubiomes Viewer

Cubiomes Viewer provides a graphical interface for the efficient and flexible seed-finding utilities provided by [cubiomes](https://github.com/Cubitect/cubiomes) and a map viewer for the Minecraft biomes and structure generation.

The tool is designed for high performance and supports Minecraft Java Edition main releases 1.0 - 1.18.


## Download

Precompiled binaries can be found for Linux and Windows under [Releases on github](https://github.com/Cubitect/cubiomes-viewer/releases). The builds are statically linked against [Qt](https://www.qt.io) and should run as-is on most newer distributions.

For the linux build you will probably have to add the executable flags to the binary (github seems to remove them upon upload).

For Arch linux users, the tool may be found in the [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/cubiomes-viewer/) thanks to [JakobDev](https://github.com/JakobDev).

Non-PC platforms, such as macOS, are not formally supported, but you can check [here](https://github.com/Cubitect/cubiomes-viewer/issues/107) for more information on this issue.
